Getopt::ArgvFile 1.0.


Overview
========

This module is a simple supplement to other option handling modules.
It allows script options and parameters to be read from files
instead of from the command line by interpolating file contents
into @ARGV. This way it PREPARES the final option handling.

Getopt::ArgvFile does NOT perform any option processing itself, and
should work fine together with any other option handling module
(e.g. Getopt::Long) or even self coded option handling.

Well, the usual process can be illustrated by the following:

                     --------------- 
 command -> @ARGV -> | Getopt::xxx |
  line               ---------------

Getopt::ArgvFile adds an additional interpolation of @ARGV, replacing
strings pointing to files with options by the contents of these files:

                          -------------                    ---------------
 command -> @ARGV with -> | Getopt::  | -> @ARGV with   -> | Getopt::xxx |
  line       file hints   |  ArgvFile |    options only    ---------------
                          -------------
                 |              ^
                 v              |
                                |
            option files --------


For example, let's say your script accepts two mandatory options ("-first"
and "-second") each taking parameters, which have to be followed by three
script parameters, the usual call would be anything like

	yourScript -first 1stPar -second 2ndPar par1 par2 par3

If a user finds out that the options and their parameters are almost
always the same for him, and if you use Getopt::ArgvFile in your script,
he could store the stable part of this call in a file like

	# always pass 1stPar to -first
	-first 1stPar

	# as well as 2ndPar to -second
	-second 2ndPar

If this file is named "opts", subsequent calls may be shortened to

	yourScript @opts par1 par2 par3

What your script will see in @ARGV after a call of
Getopt::ArgvFile::argvFile() will be exactly the same as in the initial
call showed above, so that the script can process the command line as
usual then. But from the USERS point of view, the call was simpler indeed.

More, if even the script parameters do not change from call to call,
they may be stored in a second file "pars", and the call would become

	yourScript @opts @pars

The use of Getopt::ArgvFile can simplify periodical script calls as well
as increase the handability of multi option scripts. (As an example,
imagine a cronjob set up with option files which could be completely
maintained outside the crontab.)

Further more, Getopt::ArgvFile supports both option file nesting and
cascading as well as automatically read "default option files". Please
see the documentation for details. It also contains several usage examples.


Synopsis
========

To offer support of option files, simply add something like the following
to your script:

	# load module
	use Getopt::ArgvFile qw(argvFile);
	
	# solve option files, if any
	argvFile();

Now the command line can be processed as usual, e.g. by

	Getopt::Long::GetOptions(...);


Requirements
============

Getopt::ArgvFile is tested with Perl versions 5.00[345].
It should run under later versions as well.


Installation
============

This module could be installed as usual by

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

If you are using perl 5.003, there is a bug in the core
module Text::ParseWords which is used by Getopt::ArgvFile
internally. This module cannot be installed separately,
but the version in the 5.005 core works fine. So to fix
the bug, simply update your perl core by replacing
ParseWords.pm by its 5.005 version. (This is a tip of the
packages author.) The 5.004 version should work, too, but
I did not test it.
